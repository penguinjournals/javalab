## Big Photo
Want to control the fermentation process using technology. 

Inspired on the fermentabot and domingobot.

## TODO
Will start managing only temperature (measure it and heat if colder) and will fake it locally with a light measurement sensor and a RGB LED so that green means correct temperature and red means "heating".
- Do the example code from Pi4j run as an all_in_one .jar file
- Interact with RabbitMQ to get the signals
- Develop the simplest way to display reads on a website
- Make it bootable (RabbitMQ and some jar files)
